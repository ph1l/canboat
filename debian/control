Description: NMEA 2000 (and 0183) toolkit for marine data networks
 CANboat provides NMEA 2000 (n2k) and NMEA 0183 utilities for interfacing with
 marine onboard data networks. An NMEA 2000 PGN decoder can read and decode N2K
 messages. You can also generate and publish n2k messages and send them to the
 network. USB devices, like the Actisense NGT-1 NMEA2000 PC Interface, or CAN
 devices can be used to interface with the network.
 .
 Another utility can read NMEA 0183 data and send it to stdout. the iptee
 utility can tee data to network sockets to send data across networks.
